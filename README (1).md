# Landing Page

A modern, responsive landing page scaffold aligned to your Figma file: [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/design/exmzPBnkHWYQ0TQs64xY8u/Untitled?node-id=18-2&t=4XTqbfWUosW8tmlw-1).

## Quick start
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click on Windows).
2. Replace placeholder images in `assets/images` and fonts in `assets/fonts`.
3. Customize colors, spacing, and radius in `styles.css` under `:root`.

## Structure
- `index.html`: semantic HTML with sections (`header`, `hero`, `features`, `testimonials`, `pricing`, `faq`, `footer`).
- `styles.css`: design tokens, layout, and responsive rules.
- `script.js`: mobile menu toggle and small enhancements.
- `assets/`: images and fonts.

## Mapping to Figma
- Update brand, headlines, and copy in the `hero` section.
- Adjust grid columns and gaps in `.feature-grid`, `.testimonial-grid`, and `.pricing-grid` to match your frames.
- If your Figma uses different colors/typography, set them in `:root` and body font.

## Notes
- This template favors accessibility (semantic tags, focusable controls, contrast-aware defaults).
- Keep images optimized (use `.webp` where possible) to ensure fast loads.
