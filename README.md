Landing Page
A modern, responsive landing page scaffold aligned to your Figma file: Figma design.

Quick start
Open index.html in your browser (double-click on Windows).
Replace placeholder images in assets/images and fonts in assets/fonts.
Customize colors, spacing, and radius in styles.css under :root.
Structure
index.html: semantic HTML with sections (header, hero, features, testimonials, pricing, faq, footer).
styles.css: design tokens, layout, and responsive rules.
script.js: mobile menu toggle and small enhancements.
assets/: images and fonts.
Mapping to Figma
Update brand, headlines, and copy in the hero section.
Adjust grid columns and gaps in .feature-grid, .testimonial-grid, and .pricing-grid to match your frames.
If your Figma uses different colors/typography, set them in :root and body font.
Notes
This template favors accessibility (semantic tags, focusable controls, contrast-aware defaults).
Keep images optimized (use .webp where possible) to ensure fast loads.
